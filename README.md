- The bed view will match the views in the current Dormify Collections (as of 2.5.19 found here: https://www.dormify.com/collections)
- Users will not be able to rotate the view of the bed
- Will include mobile and desktop versions
- Allow users to add products from their design to the cart as a batch
- Dormify will be responsible for product photography and editing
- Dormify will be responsible for maintenance of the visualizer, including uploading product photography, managing
- Dormify, with the guidance of HZ as requested, will source the development of the visualizer from a third party.
